# Lethal Company Unity Template
**This is a unity template project for making Custom Assets for Lethal Company.**

- This does not include any actual game assets.
- The scripts included in this are only stubs, they contain no actual game code.
- Will need to be updated after large game updates.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository from `https://github.com/EvaisaDev/LethalCompanyUnityTemplate.git`
2. Go into the game's `Managed` directory:
	- `steamapps\common\Lethal Company\Lethal Company_Data\Managed`
3. Copy the following files:
	- `AmazingAssets.TerrainToMesh.dll`
	- `ClientNetworkTransform.dll`
	- `DissonanceVoip.dll`
	- `Facepunch Transport for Netcode for GameObjects.dll`
	- `Facepunch.Steamworks.Win64.dll`
	- `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`
	- `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll`
4. Move the copied files into `Path/To/This/UnityProject/Assets/Plugins`
5. Open the project with Unity 2022.3.9f1
6. You can now use game scripts inside of this unity project, for creating custom assets!
